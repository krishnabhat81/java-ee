Java 8 - New Date/Time APIs
===========================

1. Immutable and does not have setter methods (previously java.util.Date was not thread safe, thus developers have to deal with concurrency issue while using date).
2. More utility methods for date operations (previously Default Date starts from 1900, month starts from 1, and day starts from 0, so no uniformity.).
3. Domain specific designs (previously timezone issue).

New classes introduced in java.time package:
1. Local
2. Zoned

LocalDate, LocalTime and LocalDateTime classes simplify the development where timezones are not required.
